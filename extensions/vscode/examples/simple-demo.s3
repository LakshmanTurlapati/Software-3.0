  "instructions": "This is a simple demonstration of the Software 3 format, which combines human-readable documentation with executable code in a single JSON structure. The format uses two main fields: instructions for documentation written in plain text or markdown, and code for the actual implementation. This clean structure allows for easy parsing, tool integration, and seamless switching between documentation and code views, similar to Jupyter notebooks but with a simpler JSON-based format that is language-agnostic and easy to process.",
